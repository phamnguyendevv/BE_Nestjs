# Architecture Overview

## Packaging Rules

Current Package Structure and Future Ideal Structure

```
.
├── src - The root directory for the application's source code.
│   ├── adapters - This layer contains interface adapters that convert data between the format most convenient for entities and use cases and the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web.
│   │   ├── controllers - Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses to the client. They act as a bridge between the web and the application logic.
│   │   │   ├── common - Common utilities and helpers for controllers.
│   │   │   │   ├── guards - Guards are used to protect routes and enforce authorization.
│   │   │   │   ├── decorators - Custom decorators for enhancing controller classes, methods, or parameters.
│   │   │   │   ├── middlewares - Middleware functions that process requests before they reach the controllers (only applicable to specific controllers).
│   │   │   └── [feature] - A directory dedicated to a specific feature of the application, containing related controllers.
│   │   │       ├── dto - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to define the format of data as it is transferred from the client to the server.
│   │   │       ├── presenters - Presenters are responsible for transforming data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities into a format that can be returned to and understood by the client.
│   │   │       └── [feature].controller.ts - A specific controller for handling requests related to a feature.
│   │   └── gateways - Gateways are responsible for handling real-time communication, often through WebSockets.
│   │       └── [feature] - A directory for gateways related to a specific feature.
│   │           ├── dto - Similar to controllers, these DTOs are for the input data in real-time communication.
│   │           ├── presenters - Presenters for transforming output data in real-time communication.
│   │           └── [feature].gateway.ts - A specific gateway for handling real-time events related to a feature.
│   │

│   │   ├── entities - Domain entities are the business objects of the application.
│   │   ├── utils - Pure functions and helpers that can be used across different use cases.
│   │   │   └── [utility].utils.ts - Specific utility functions for various purposes, such as string.utils.ts, datetime.utils.ts, etc.
│   │   ├── repositories - Interfaces for the data access layer. They abstract the persistence layer, allowing the use cases to access the data without knowing the implementation details.
│   │   ├── services - Interfaces for the application services. These interfaces define the contracts for the infrastructure layer to implement, including services that interact with third-party services or external APIs.
│   │   ├── config - Configuration interfaces specific to the domain layer.
│   │   ├── exceptions - Custom exceptions that represent errors within the domain layer.
│   │   └── logger - Interfaces for logging, allowing the domain layer to log information without depending on a specific logging implementation.

│   │   ├── exceptions - Implementations of exception handling mechanisms.
│   │   └── logger - Implementations of the logging interface, providing concrete logging capabilities.
│   │
│   ├── use-cases - This layer contains the application-specific business rules. It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system, handling business logic and interacting with repositories.
│   │
│   ├── modules - Organizational units that group related code together. Each module is dedicated to a specific area of functionality within the application.
│   │
│   ├── app.module.ts - The root module of the application. It ties all the modules together.

# Clean Code Guidelines

---

description: Guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and human-readable code. Apply these rules when writing or reviewing code to ensure consistency and quality.
globs:

---

## Constants Over Magic Numbers

- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names

- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments

- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility

- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure

- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation

- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance

- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing

- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control

- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names

## Verify Information

Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes

Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies

Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback

Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions

Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries

Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions

Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations

Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code

Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits

Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks

Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates

Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links

Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation

Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

# TypeScript General Guidelines

## Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Avoid using any.
- Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

## Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
- Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
- Except for well-known abbreviations:
  - i, j for loops
  - err for errors
  - ctx for contexts
  - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

## Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
- Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
- Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

## Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
- Use as const for literals that don't change.

## Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

## Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
- Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

# TypeScript Best Practices

---

description: TypeScript coding standards and best practices for modern web development
globs: **/\*.ts, **/_.tsx, \*\*/_.d.ts

---

## Type System

- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions
- Use type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
- Avoid using `any`, prefer `unknown` for unknown types
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types
- Use generics for reusable type patterns

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for type names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)

## Code Organization

- Keep type definitions close to where they're used
- Export types and interfaces from dedicated type files when shared
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for organizing exports
- Place shared types in a `types` directory
- Co-locate component props with their components

## Functions

- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use function overloads for complex type scenarios
- Prefer async/await over Promises

## Best Practices

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Leverage discriminated unions for type safety
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Implement proper null checking
- Avoid type assertions unless necessary

## Error Handling

- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Use Result types for operations that can fail
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks with typed catch clauses
- Handle Promise rejections properly

## Patterns

- Use the Builder pattern for complex object creation
- Implement the Repository pattern for data access
- Use the Factory pattern for object creation
- Leverage dependency injection
- Use the Module pattern for encapsulation
